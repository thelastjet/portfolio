        <h1>Work History:</h1>
        <h2>Self Employed: Process Server</h2>
        <p>In this position I serve legal documents to individuals and businesses that are involved in some type of
            legal dispute. Over the last 11 years, I have learned a lot about how to communicate with people in such a way
            that they will stay calm when receiving these legal papers. I have also gotten very good at noticing when people
            are not being truthful. I have learned how to use a few different resources on the internet to look up information
            about who owns a house, who may be living there, when the house was last sold and other relevant information. This
            helps when I am writing up the notes when making attempts to serve the documents. Being self employed means I can
            accept documents to serve from many different companies so I can stay very busy most of the time, unless of course there
            is a pandemic and everything shuts down.
        </p>
        <h2>Self Employed: Satellite Technician</h2>
        <p>For approximately 5 years I installed and repaired satellite systems for Dish Network and DirecTv. I was able to learn
            all of the technical aspects of how a satellite dish system works as well as the best way to install them for optimal
            performance. I learned how to communicate very well with customers. I would let them know where I needed to install the satellite dish to get the best
            signal strength and make sure they were okay with that location. I would also explain how any cables would be run and where
            I would place the satellite boxes near their televisions. When I was finished with the installation I would activate any
            receivers and then show the customer how to use everything properly. If I was going to a house to fix an issue instead of
            installing a new system, I would listen very carefully to the customer to make sure I understood the problem. Over the 5 years
            I learned how to troubleshoot any issues and became very good at fixing the system.

        <h1>Hobbies:</h1>
        <p>I currently participate in a 1-hour group fitness class at OrangeTheory Fitness. I go to these classes early in
            morning Monday through Saturday almost every week. I have been going to these classes for a little over 4 years
            minus any time they were closed during the pandemic. I believe taking these classes is extremely important in order
            to remain healthy both in physical and mental health.

            Besides going to these classes I usually run a few miles a couple of times a week. In 2019 I ran in 5 different 5K races
            beating my previous time in each race. I am planning on running a half marathon later this year.

            I also enjoy watching the Minnesota Vikings during the NFL season. I enjoy watching college football, college
            basketball, and college softball as well.
